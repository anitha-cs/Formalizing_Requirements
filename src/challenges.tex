\section{Formal Requirements Analysis Challenges and Mitigations}
\label{sec:challenge}

In this section, we elaborate on four challenges that, we believe, have the potential to undermine the rigor and usefulness of formal techniques yet have not been brought to light in any existing literature. In the sequel we explain our approach to addressing them.

%In this section, we elaborate on four challenges that we believe is not limited to the GPCA case example but encountered by engineers working on similar applications, especially in the safety critical system domain. In our opinion, these challenges have the potential to undermine the rigor and usefulness of formal techniques yet has not be adequately discussed or addressed in any existing literature.

%Although we successfully demonstrated the approach using the GPCA, our journey from GPCA's natural language requirements to the fully verified formalized system, component and sub-component requirements was not easy. We faced a number of challenges that we believe is typically encountered by engineering performing similar tasks. In this section we describe those challenges in detail.

%Even after brief training about the tools and notations, the team member formalizing and verifying the system faced a number of challenges that we believe is typically encountered by engineering performing similar tasks. In this section we describe the challenges in detail, that we believe are critical yet not highlighted in the existing literature.
