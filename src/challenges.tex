\section{Requirements Engineering Challenges}
\label{sec:challenge}

Although we successfully demonstrated the approach using the GPCA, our journey from GPCA's natural language requirements to the fully verified formalized system, component and sub-component requirements was not easy. We faced a number of challenges that we believe is typically encountered by engineering performing similar tasks. In this section we describe those challenges in detail.
