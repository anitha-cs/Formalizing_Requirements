\section{Requirements Engineering Challenges}
\label{sec:challenge}

%Although we successfully demonstrated the approach using the GPCA, our journey from GPCA's natural language requirements to the fully verified formalized system, component and sub-component requirements was not easy. We faced a number of challenges that we believe is typically encountered by engineering performing similar tasks. In this section we describe those challenges in detail.

Even after brief training about the tools and notations, the team member formalizing and verifying the system faced a number of challenges that we believe is typically encountered by engineering performing similar tasks. In this section we describe the challenges in detail, that we believe are critical yet not highlighted in the existing literature.
