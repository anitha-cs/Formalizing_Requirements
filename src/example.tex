\section{Background}
\label{sec:gpca-overview}

In this section, we describe our prior work~\cite{hilt2013, req2code} on modeling and formally verifying the requirements of an infusion pump that forms the basis of this paper. We provide a brief overview of an infusion pump system, its modeling and verification activities that is required to understand the formalization challenges described later in the paper. Infusion pumps are medical cyber physical systems used for controlled delivery of liquid drugs into a patient's body according to a physician's prescription (the set of instructions that governs infusion rates for a medication). Unfortunately, these devices have been involved in many hazardous incidents that triggered the need to strengthen the current system development practices for such systems. Our aim is to demonstrate a rigours model based development approach using a generic infusion pump system that, along with the artifacts we develop in the process, can be be used as a reference for researchers, manufacturers and certification authorities.

\subsection {System Overview}
We considered a Generic Patient Controlled Analgesia Infusion Pump (GPCA), a special type of infusion pump that allows patients to self-administer a controlled amount of additional drug. %Figure~\ref{fig:gpca-overview} shows a GPCA device in a typical usage environment in which a clinician sets up the device and the patient receives the medication from the device through an intravenous needle according to the programmed prescription. To enhance safety of the device it is usually connected to a repository (hospital pharmacy database) that stores manufacturer provided drug limits.

In order to analyse the problems associated with modern infusion pumps available in the market, we considered several advanced capabilities in the GPCA. For instance, we considered three types of infusion options for drug delivery for the GPCA - (a) \emph{basal} infusion in which the drug is delivered at a constant (and usually low) rate for an extended period of
time, (b) \emph{intermittent bolus} infusion that delivers drug at a higher rate for a short duration at prescribed time intervals according to some therapy regimen, and (c) \emph{patient bolus} that delivers additional drug in response to a patient's request for more medication. In addition, we also considered advanced safety features in the device to detect hazardous anomalies/behaviours and mitigate it by notifying the clinician and/or inhibiting infusion and other device operations.

\subsection {System Modeling and Verification}

Our interest with the GPCA is to develop and demonstrate a rigours end-to-end development approach. We captured a reasonably complete set of overall system requirements using documentation patterns~\cite{mavin2009easy} and standard templates~\cite{IEEEFormats} that we thought will make the task of formalizing requirements straightforward in the verification phases. We followed a model based approach to reason about the requirements and hence developed behavioral models of the GPCA. However, to cope with the complexity of modeling the GPCA behaviours, we had to hierarchically decompose it into various components. This induced the need to identify an architecture (components and its interconnections) and precise requirements for each component at every level in the system hierarchy until the leaf-level in the decomposition. We used Architectural Analysis \& Design Language (AADL) to capture the architecture of the GPCA (components and its interconnections) and an extension of the AADL language that supports specification of formal textual requirements along with its respective components (and system) in the AADL model. While this architecture driven requirements decomposition allowed us to systematically identify component requirements that satisfy their parent level requirements in the system hierarchy, at the leaf-leaf the components were just described by their requirements. Hence, to reason about the leaf level component behaviours, we modeled the detailed behaviour of each component using MathWorks Simulink/Stateflow notation and tool.

To rigorously verify these hierarchically decomposed requirements with respect to their models, we used a number of tools and techniques. First, to verify the correctness of the architecture driven requirements decomposition we used a compositional reasoning tool named AGREE~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu}. Given the system architecture and the allocated requirements (captured as assumptions and guarantees) for both the system and its components, AGREE hierarchically verifies if the system level guarantees holds as a logical consequence of both its immediate child component contracts and system level assumptions. AGREE uses a bottom up approach in which it verifies one level of decomposition at a time. Starting from the leaf-level it verifies if its parent level requirement are satisfiable given the leaf-level requirements. Using these verification results, it now automatically tries to verify the next higher level requirements and so on until the top most level is reached. Since AGREE assumes the leaf-level requirements, to ensure the correctness of those requirements with respect to their detailed behavioural model we used Simulink Design Verifier. This involved recapturing the requirements in AGREE notation to a notation supported by Simulink Design Verifier. Fortunately, the recapture was straightforward since the notations used by both the tools were semantically same and syntactically similar. Hence, we manually recaptured the properties between the notations without any difficulty. This approach and tool chain allowed us to rigorously demonstrate an end-to-end system verification using tools and notations commonly used in the industry.

While our approach was very efficient and led to a complete verification of a hierarchically composed software architecture, the challenges in adopting the approach was not visible until we applied it "at scale" involving multiple developers over an extended period of time. We initially demonstrated the above approach only using a small set of infusion pump safety requirements (18 requirements). Hence, to implement this approach to the entire GPCA - that had 86 total requirements - we allocated the task of formally formalizing and verifying them hierarchically in the GPCA model to one team member among us who had experience using these tools. We initially assumed this task was straightforward and planned 6 weeks for the activity. Unfortunately, we soon started facing a number of challenges in the process of formalizing the GPCA, whose overall system complexity and size is comparable to a real industrial system. In the following sections, we elaborate on those challenges and our approach to address them. 

%
%when we started formalizing all the requirements of the infusion pump and verifying them we faced a number of challenges. The GPCA system has a total of 86 requirements and for the verification we selected 56 requirements that were relevant to the software of the GPCA. We allocated the task of formally formalizing and verifying these 56 requirements hierarchically in the GPCA model to one team member among us who was not involved in developing the approach.

%To demonstrate such an development, it is absolutely crucial to have a suitable set of system requirements from which to start; to prove that the system (system model) does not pose a certain hazard, a precise description of the hazard avoidance or mitigation should be documented as requirements.

%we developed a requirements document for the GPCA by capturing requirements using various requirements discovery techniques.

%
%
% Since, the existing publicly available requirements documents did not meet our standards of completeness, consistency, and rigor, we began  developing a suitable requirements document for the GPCA. To discover the requirements of the GPCA, especially requirements related to continuous and continual aspects of the physical components used to build GPCA and its environment, we used a continuous domain model based approach. It helped us understand and precisely document the tolerances and allowances that had to be included in the system requirements, to account for inaccuracies of GPCA's physical components and environment. %While we documented the system level requirements using natural language, we had to move to a more formal notation as we begun the design and development of the system.
%
%To cope with complexity of modeling the GPCA, we hierarchically decomposed the system into various components. We used Architectural Analysis \& Design Language (AADL) to capture the architecture of the GPCA (components and its interconnections). The decomposition into components induces the need to identify how to precisely allocate requirements to each component in such a way that the system requirement is met. We captured GPCA and its component requirements using an extension of the AADL language that supports specification of formal textual requirements along with its respective components (and system) in the AADL model. This decomposition was not a simple requirements allocation task but an analysis activity in which we had to rigorously ascertain if the component requirements satisfies the system level requirements. For instance, we decomposed the GPCA's software (one of GPCA's components) into 8 sub-components to cope with complexity. To reason about the decomposition of GPCA software's requirements was not easy and hence we used a tool named AGREE~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu}. It is a compositional reasoning tool that helps automatically reason about the decomposition of requirements captured within AADL models.
%
%AGREE is based on assume-guarantee reasoning. In this style of reasoning, the requirements on components and system are captured as a \emph{Contracts}. A contract is an assume-guarantee pair in which ``guarantees" correspond to the promises that the component (or system) should satisfy, and ``assume'' correspond to the environmental constraints that are used (or necessary) to verify the promises. Given the system architecture and the contracts for both the system and its components, AGREE automatically verifies if the system level guarantees holds as a logical consequence of both component contracts and system level assumptions. While AGREE helped verify the correctness of GPCA software's contracts, it did so by assuming the correctness of the sub-component contracts. Hence, to verify if the sub-component contracts are indeed satisfied, we modeled and verified each of GPCA component using MathWorks tool suite.
%
%For modeling the GPCA software sub-components we used MathWorks Simulink/Stateflow and verified them using Simulink Design Verifier (SDV) tool. SDV verifies if requirements formalized as properties, using one of its supported notations, are satisfied by a Simulink model of the system. For the GPCA, we recaptured the component contracts in AGREE to properties using Embedded Matlab notation (supported by SDV) and verified if the component models satisfy them using SDV. We choose Embedded Matlab over the other options to formalize properties in SDV since its semantics to specify properties is the same as the the semantics of the notation used in AGREE to capture contracts. While our future plan is to automate the contract to property translation, due to time constraints we manually recaptured them for the GPCA.

%
%In addition, we also considered sophisticated validation features in the GPCA, such as  ensures if the entered values are within the safe limits as described in the hospital pharmacy database. In addition, the GPCA shall also have the capability to notify the clinician when exceptional conditions occur. These exceptional conditions include detecting anomalies in environment and unexpected device behaviours that may pose hazards to the patients. These exceptional conditions have varying levels of severity and expected system responses, such as buzzers, led lights and display of message and also inhibit infusion and other operations. In short, the GPCA system has three primary functions (1) deliver the drug based on the prescribed schedule and patient requests, (2) prevent hazards that may arise during its usage, and (3) monitor and notify the clinician of any exceptional conditions encountered. %The infusion, configuration and alarming capabilities are orthogonal to each other, that is, they function in parallel, but have the capability to affect each other's operation.
%
%Unfortunately, these devices have been involved in many incidents that have resulted in harm to the patient. Hence, The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)~\cite{fda2010whitepaper} in collaboration with the research community sought to pro-actively promote the development of infusion pumps that are safe to use. To contribute to this initiative, we developed an archetype of system development artifacts and demonstrated an end-to-end model based development approach for a generic
%infusion pump system, that could serve as a generic reference standard used by infusion pump manufactures and certification authorities.
